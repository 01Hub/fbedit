1.0.6.7
o Added line changed indicator. The default yellow for unsaved line and green for saved line can be changed.
o FbEdit can now read Linux files with LF line termination (Windows uses CR+LF).
o Added Chinese translation. Thanks esir.
o Fixed bug with line continuation. Would cause a crash if line continuation was combined with comment block.
