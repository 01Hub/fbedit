Whats new:
----------
1.0.5.9
o Updated resource editor.
  - Added Undo / Redo to dialog editor.
    NOTE! Undo / Redo resets Send to Back / Bring to Front.
    The only way to avoid this problem is to properly set the tabindexes.
    Most important is that a GroupBox or Tab control should have a lower tabindex
    than all the controls it contain.
  - Added support for IDOK / IDCANCEL to Button control.
  - Added support for IDC_STATIC to Static, Image and Shape controls.
  - Added option to define IDC_STATIC
  - Added better support for multiline captions (Edit, Static and Button controls).
    NOTE. Use Ctrl+Enter to insert a new line in the multiline text box.
  - Fixed bugs with Image and Animate controls (name / id problems).
  - Fixed bug with #include <windows.h>.
  - Fixed bug with Add XP Manifest. #define MANIFEST 24 was not included.
    This caused the applicationt you crated to not run.
o Fixed bugs in code parser (RAProperty.dll)
o Fixed bug with file changed outside editor. Could give more than one message.
o Fixed block bug "If(Len(argv)=0 ) Then".
