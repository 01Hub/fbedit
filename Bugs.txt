I run FBEdit from my thumbdrive. If I open a file from the File Menu, the next time I open FbEdit on a different Computer (with different drive letters), It will give me several File Read errors.
It is trying to read the recently used file list. If I open the file from the browser box on the right side of the screen, I don't have this problem. It only happens when I go in through the file menu.

1-It seem that FBEdit don't make any difference between structure and pointer to structure in the code completion.
If i use Dim xxx as ITEMIDLIST i can access members with xxx.mkid or xxx->mkid.
2-If i declare Dim xxx as LPITEMIDLIST i cannot acces members with code completion, but if i declare Dim xxx as ITEMIDLIST ptr then i can access members (with '.' or '->')
3-To be able to access members with code completion (as in 1 & 2), i must drop/add the .bi to the project. The #include is not enought
Anyway FreeBasic is great and FBEdit is the best IDE for it !!!

go back to "print" and press return
Code:
