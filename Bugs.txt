RESOURCE EDITOR

** 1. If I create a new resource script for my program using "New"->"Resource file", I have to add at least one resource, anyway it won't compile

** 2. If I enter a text with a lenght of 255 chars in the multiline caption field, the last 2 chars get cutted off if I want to edit it using the one-line caption field. (The strange thing is - I can readd the 2 chars using the one-line captino field!)

** 3. If I change the type of a dialog from "Dialog" to "ModalFrame", the Icon in the upper-left corner of the dialog stays until I reopen the dialog (e.g. by opening IDD_DLG2 and then IDD_DLG1 again)


CODE COMPLETION / TOOLTIP WINDOW

4. For Get, Put, Line, Circle, Point, PSet, Window and Draw String there is no tooltip window

** 5. If I want to to add a comment to an "#include"-line, the tooltip window stays present even after the last doublequote (e.g. #include "windows.bi" ' This is a comment --- the tooltip window stays there even while I'm typing "This is a comment")

** 6. "Function foo StdCall (bar As Integer) As Byte" - the tooltip window and the function list show "foo() Stdcall" instead of "foo(bar:Integer) Byte"

** 7. If I'm typing too fast, it happens that the tooltip window stays present until I press ENTER, showing ALL keywords, functions, types, enums, and so on. Is there any way to get in this mode manually? I mean - I want to show the tooltip window all FB keywords or all Functions (e.g. by pressing CTRL+F5 or something like this)
Press Ctrl+Space

8. If I use this:

Type Test
x As Integer
Enum
XA
XB
End Enum
y As Integer
Enum
YA
YB
End Enum
End Type

The tooltip window shows:

x:Integer
Enum:
XA:
XB:
y:Integer
Enum:
YA:
YB:

Is this done purposefully?

9. There are lots of problems with namespaces, espicially if I'm using several source files

**10. " ''/' " is counted as beginning of a multi-line comment, but is actually isn't one.

''/' Here comes a beep!
Beep

The program beeps, but FBEdit shows "Beep" green.

11. FBEdit ignores "Asm..End Asm", it tries to highlight FB keywords anyway (and uses code completion!)

Asm
xor eax, eax <<< "xor" gets highlighted
mov ebx, [esi + 4]
sub ebx, 8 <<< "sub" gets highlighted
End Asm

12. Preprocessor lines are only highlighted right if there are no spaces between "#" and the keyword

#ifdef _TEST_ <<< correct
# print "Test!" <<< incorrect
#endif <<< correct

13. Code completion doesn't work correctly if the cursor isn't at the end of the word

| = Cursor

** Issue 1:
MultiKey(SC_ESCAPE|
MultiKey(SC_ES|CAPE
after pressing ENTER:
MultiKey(SC_ESCAPE|CAPE

Issue 2:
MultiKey(SC_ESC|
Mu|ltiKey(SC_ESC
The tooltip window still shows "SC_ESCAPE"


I hope, I could help.

** Bug in RAResEd

When saving a resource file (with exporting the names into rsrc.bi), 
the combo box above the property table loses all its entries and 
contains just one meaningless entry named "#define".

Editing the XP manifest in the resource editor or changing the filename doesn't work as expected,
the changes are not saved. 

** Fixed: Writing RCDATA in resource editor and then deleting some parts of it causes FBEdit to add garbage data at the end so it won't compile. 

The resource editor displays scrollbars around all its child dialogs which let you scroll them away, 
which is senseless. 

** Bug in FbEdit

The resource editor sometimes destroys menus when adding/deleting items in 
the middle of it. I can't tell you the cause exactly. 

** Fixed:Deleting custom resource types doesn't work. 

** Fixed:Clearing the "Filter" field of custom resource types doesn't work, neither does adding one with a clear "Filter" field. 

When pressing backspace while typing a #include file name, the auto-completion box disappears 
and doesn't reappear until deleting and re-typing the first doublequote. 

The auto-complete box doesn't handle With blocks inside Namespaces correctly.

And when you modify the Options->Helps Menu, it still doesn't re-save the path in .ini, so you loose your help path ...
