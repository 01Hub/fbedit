RESOURCE EDITOR

** 1. If I create a new resource script for my program using "New"->"Resource file", I have to add at least one resource, anyway it won't compile

** 2. If I enter a text with a lenght of 255 chars in the multiline caption field, the last 2 chars get cutted off if I want to edit it using the one-line caption field. (The strange thing is - I can readd the 2 chars using the one-line captino field!)

** 3. If I change the type of a dialog from "Dialog" to "ModalFrame", the Icon in the upper-left corner of the dialog stays until I reopen the dialog (e.g. by opening IDD_DLG2 and then IDD_DLG1 again)


CODE COMPLETION / TOOLTIP WINDOW

4. For Get, Put, Line, Circle, Point, PSet, Window and Draw String there is no tooltip window

** 5. If I want to to add a comment to an "#include"-line, the tooltip window stays present even after the last doublequote (e.g. #include "windows.bi" ' This is a comment --- the tooltip window stays there even while I'm typing "This is a comment")

** 6. "Function foo StdCall (bar As Integer) As Byte" - the tooltip window and the function list show "foo() Stdcall" instead of "foo(bar:Integer) Byte"

** 7. If I'm typing too fast, it happens that the tooltip window stays present until I press ENTER, showing ALL keywords, functions, types, enums, and so on. Is there any way to get in this mode manually? I mean - I want to show the tooltip window all FB keywords or all Functions (e.g. by pressing CTRL+F5 or something like this)
Press Ctrl+Space

8. If I use this:

Type Test
x As Integer
Enum
XA
XB
End Enum
y As Integer
Enum
YA
YB
End Enum
End Type

The tooltip window shows:

x:Integer
Enum:
XA:
XB:
y:Integer
Enum:
YA:
YB:

Is this done purposefully?

9. There are lots of problems with namespaces, espicially if I'm using several source files

**10. " ''/' " is counted as beginning of a multi-line comment, but is actually isn't one.

''/' Here comes a beep!
Beep

The program beeps, but FBEdit shows "Beep" green.

11. FBEdit ignores "Asm..End Asm", it tries to highlight FB keywords anyway (and uses code completion!)

Asm
xor eax, eax <<< "xor" gets highlighted
mov ebx, [esi + 4]
sub ebx, 8 <<< "sub" gets highlighted
End Asm

12. Preprocessor lines are only highlighted right if there are no spaces between "#" and the keyword

#ifdef _TEST_ <<< correct
# print "Test!" <<< incorrect
#endif <<< correct

13. Code completion doesn't work correctly if the cursor isn't at the end of the word

| = Cursor

** Issue 1:
MultiKey(SC_ESCAPE|
MultiKey(SC_ES|CAPE
after pressing ENTER:
MultiKey(SC_ESCAPE|CAPE

Issue 2:
MultiKey(SC_ESC|
Mu|ltiKey(SC_ESC
The tooltip window still shows "SC_ESCAPE"


I hope, I could help.
