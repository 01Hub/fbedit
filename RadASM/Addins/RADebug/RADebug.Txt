RadASM source code debug addin.

NOTE!
The addin uses dbghelp.dll version 6.4 or higher.

How to install:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Copy RADebug.dll to C:\RadASM\Addins
o Copy RADebug.txt to C:\RadASM\Addins\Help
o Start RadASM and use Options/Addin Manager to activate addin.
  - There is an option to show DbgHelp output.

How to make (masm):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Assemble with the /Zd and /Zi options.
o Link with the /DEBUG option.

How to debug:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Set a breakpoint in your source using Make/Debug/Toggle Breakpoint
0 Select Make/Debug/Run
  - You will get a warning on unhandled breakpoints if you set a breakpoint
    on a line that does not produce any code.
  - You will get an error if there are unsaved source files.
  - You will get an error if any source files are newer than the exe.
  - Execution will halt when a breakpoint is reached.
    Output window #1 will show some debug info.
    Output window #2 will show registers.
  - Use Step Into, Step Over, Run To Caret or Run to continue execution.
  - Use Toggle Breakpoint to set a new breakpoint or use Clear Breakpoints
    to clear all breakpoints.
  - Use Stop to stop execution.
  - Multithreading is supported. Each thread gets to execute one line
    at a time, very confusing.
  - Use Do Not Debug to select procs that you dont want to debug. Typically
    you dont want to debug the WndProc and the messageloop (WinMain) in a GUI
    application.
o NOTE!
  - The debug menu will be disabled if no project is open or the debugger
    can not find any debug info.
  - The addin will only work with RadASM 2.2.1.6 or higher.
