0.9.10 (2008-05-08)

Update to version 0.9.10 of fidlib.  Update of fidlib and fiview
source to compile with GCC 4.

---

0.9.8 (2004-09-06)

Fidlib correction to auto-adjust to -3.01dB (70.71%) not 50% when '=' used.
Fidlib window-function low-pass filters now give correct widths at -3.01dB
Filter response analysis now performed at half-power and quarter-power points,
  i.e. 70.71% (sqrt 0.5) and 50% (-3.01dB and -6.02dB), instead of just at 50%
Ruler 'm' display now showing 70.71% and 50% points instead of just 50% points
Fidlib added fid_list_filters_buf() function
No longer uses strstream (no more "dev_null.txt" on Windows)

---

0.9.7 (2004-08-20)

Added window functions (Bartlet, Hann, Hamming, Blackman).

---

0.9.6 (2004-03-16)

Fixed up some non-ANSI code that newer GCC complained about.

---

0.9.5 (2003-08-22)

Fixed false internal error report from pair_filters() on Windows due
  to error detection not allowing leeway for slight calculation errors.

---

0.9.4 (2003-06-14)

Updates to fidlib source to support fidlib compilation with MSVC.

---

0.9.3 (2003-06-11)

Changed from using -a option to the '=' prefix to indicate
  auto-adjustment of frequencies.  For example: "BpBe4/=1000-1500" or
  "-f =250" or whatever.
Auto-adjustment now fully implemented
Added a demo set of filters to allow a quick startup of fiview:
  fiview -D
Permit up to 10 filters to be switched with the keyboard
Added 'unmaintained' #error to JIT code in fidlib
Fidlib contains some fixes to aid compilation on MSVC (MSVC handling
  could be improved, though)
BpBq and BsBq now expect a single centre frequency instead of the
  incorrect frequency range required previously.
Filter parsing is now performed in Fidlib
Some other fixes

0.9.2 (2003-01-27)

Min/max/50% rulers and labelling on freq-display ('m' key)
Log-scale freq-display views ('l' key)
Sweep and wavelet testing modes on frequency display ('f' key)
Windows file-loading weirdness dealt with
New 'fiview.coef' output file giving IIR/FIR coefficients in 
  reloadable format
Sampling rate may now appear before any of the other options
Auto-adjust feature added for Lp and Hp filters (-a option)
Better zoom mode for time-display ('z' key)
Better zoom/expand mode for freq-display ('z' + 'x')
Direct fidlib-calling code also included in examples
Option to just analyse and quit instead of entering GUI
Dropped 'h', 'i', 'f' and 't' keys for switching between displays;
  only F1-F4 keys available now.  (Alt-? or Ctrl-? could be used 
  instead if people need this feature)
Fixed small display adjust bug for frequency display upper bound
Added experimental lowpass Butterworth-Bessel cross filter (LpBuBe)
Added Blackman window (LpBl)
Updated helptext

0.9.1

Added more example code to fiview.log output, including a
compiler-optimised version, and also example code to generate other
filters in the same class at run-time.  Most of the other changes were
internal code reorganization and clean-up to support these additions,
plus code in fidlib to generate the required coefficients at run-time.
Also now displays better filters that go on forever (for example
oscillators like BpRe/0/0.01).
