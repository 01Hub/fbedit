SETUP
-----
RadASM must be configured to reflect your installation of RadASM, assembler / compiler  and help files.

Option / Environment
--------------------
The environment must be set up for each assembler / compiler.
By default the environment is configured to assume:
- RadASM is installed in DRIVE:\RadASM
- Masm is installed to DRIVE:\Masm32 with the binaries in bin folder, include files in include
  folder and libraries in lib folder.
- GoAsm is installed to DRIVE:\GoAsm with the binaries in bin folder and include files in headers.

The environment has been made relative to the RadASM folder so you can have everything on a
memory stick where the drive letter can change.

Option / Make
-------------
Here you specify make types and assembler / linker / compiler commandline switches and the
resulting output file. There can be max 32 make types. To help protect your computer the
actual exe to run is specified in Assembler.ini, not in the project file.

Option / Tools Menu
------------------
Here you can add tools that you often use.
The menu is specific to each assembler / compiler.

Option / Help Menu
------------------
Here you can add help files and links to web sites.
The menu is specific to each assembler / compiler.

Option / F1-Help
----------------
Here you must specify help files for api, rc and assembler / compiler.
The F1-Help is specific to each assembler / compiler.
The Option / Code Editor / Syntax words is used to select wich help file to show.
